✅ COMPLETED (Jan 11, 2026 - Evening):
- Implemented 23-hour rolling reset for PTC ads (Surf Ads)
- Added automatic cleanup of completion records for expired ads
- PTC ads now use isPTCAdCompleted() with 23-hour timer
- Simple Tasks remain one-time only using isTaskCompleted()
- Sync help link fixed (relative path instead of absolute)
- Implemented comment-based include system for sidebar (edit once, update all pages)

PENDING:
- Context/docs organization for multiple projects (3 active)
- Simple Tasks: Need server-side completion tracking to prevent localStorage bloat from old one-time tasks
  * Current: localStorage stores all completed tasks forever
  * Problem: Will grow indefinitely as users complete tasks
  * Solution: Implement cleanup similar to PTC ads, or server-side tracking
