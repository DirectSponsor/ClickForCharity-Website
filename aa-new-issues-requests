✅ COMPLETED (Jan 11, 2026):
- Created balance-sync-help.html page with comprehensive sync documentation

---

❌ REVERTED (Jan 11, 2026):
- PTC ads bug fix was reverted - original issue needs investigation
- User clarified: PTC ads (Surf Ads) should reset daily, Simple Tasks should be one-time only
- The shared isTaskCompleted() function can't handle both behaviors currently

---

PENDING:
- Context/docs organization for multiple projects (3 active)
- PTC ads showing as "completed today" even when not completed - needs proper daily reset mechanism
- Simple Tasks: Need server-side completion tracking to prevent localStorage bloat from old one-time tasks
  * Current: localStorage stores all completed tasks forever
  * Problem: Will grow indefinitely as users complete tasks
  * Solution needed: Server-side tracking or periodic cleanup mechanism for tasks that no longer exist
