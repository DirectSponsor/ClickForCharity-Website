The simple tasks -- I completed the Like our latest post task and it does not go away, its still there when i return and click completed. Maybe it should be kept but greyed out and made inactive, and then disappear on next page load, because it would seems trange if it jsut vanishes when the user clicks to say it is completed, but at the moment I can do it over and over again.
